# Mask Banao

## Installation

Please see [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) instructions on how to install jekyll. I recommend using [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to handle ruby. 


Once all is set up just run:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site should work on localhost:4000

(note will soon switch to webpack but for now this should work)
